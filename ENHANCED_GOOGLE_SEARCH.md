# Enhanced Google Places API Course Search

## Overview

The Google Places API course search has been significantly enhanced to improve golf course discovery with expanded radius coverage and better state validation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Expanded Search Radius
- **Previous**: 50-75km radius
- **Enhanced**: 100-150km radius
- **Impact**: Covers much larger areas from each coordinate point, reducing gaps in coverage

### 2. Enhanced Search Strategies
- **Previous**: 4 search strategies
- **Enhanced**: 10 search strategies
- **New strategies include**:
  - "country club" searches
  - "public golf" and "private golf" searches  
  - "golf resort" searches
  - Searches without type restrictions for broader coverage

### 3. Improved State Validation
- **Previous**: Single reverse geocoding method
- **Enhanced**: Multi-method validation approach
  - Primary: Reverse geocoding with Google API
  - Secondary: Address parsing from course data
  - Fallback: Place details formatted address parsing
  - Comprehensive state abbreviation mapping

### 4. Additional Coordinate Coverage
- **Enhanced**: Added more coordinate points to larger states
- **Examples**:
  - California: 15 → 20 points
  - Texas: 15 → 20 points  
  - Florida: 14 → 18 points
  - New York: 9 → 12 points
- **Impact**: Better coverage of rural and suburban areas

## Technical Details

### Search Strategy Configuration
```ruby
search_strategies = [
  { keyword: "golf course", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "golf club", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "country club", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "municipal golf", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "public golf", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "private golf", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "golf resort", type: "golf_course", radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "golf", type: "golf_course", radius: 150000 },
  { keyword: "golf course", type: nil, radius: 100000 },
  { keyword: "country club golf", type: nil, radius: 100000 },
]
```

### State Validation Process
1. **Reverse Geocoding**: Use Google's geocoding API to get state from coordinates
2. **Address Parsing**: Extract state from course vicinity/formatted address
3. **State Mapping**: Convert abbreviations to full state names
4. **Validation Logic**: Use most reliable result with fallback options

### Enhanced Coordinate Points
States with additional coverage points:
- **Large States**: California, Texas, Florida, New York
- **Rural States**: Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Alaska
- **Complex Geography**: Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina

## Usage

### Test Enhanced Search
```bash
# Test on a specific state (uses first 2 coordinate points)
rails golf:test_enhanced_search[Wyoming]
```

### Run Enhanced Discovery
```bash
# Single state with full coverage
rails golf:enhanced_discovery_single_state[Wyoming]

# All states with enhanced coverage
rails golf:enhanced_discovery_all_states
```

### Compare with Previous Method
```bash
# Previous method (still available)
rails golf:comprehensive_course_discovery

# Enhanced method
rails golf:enhanced_discovery_all_states
```

## Expected Improvements

### Coverage Expansion
- **Radius increase**: ~4x area coverage per coordinate point
- **Strategy increase**: 2.5x more search variations
- **Coordinate increase**: 20-30% more coverage points

### State Accuracy
- **Reduced false positives**: Better filtering of out-of-state courses
- **Improved edge case handling**: Border areas and complex addresses
- **Enhanced logging**: Better debugging of state validation process

### Discovery Efficiency
- **Fewer missed courses**: Larger radius catches more distant courses
- **Better rural coverage**: Additional coordinate points in sparse areas
- **Reduced API calls**: More efficient per-call discovery

## Monitoring and Validation

### Success Metrics
- Number of new courses discovered per state
- Accuracy of state assignment (manual spot checks)
- Reduction in "missed" courses from known golf directories

### Quality Checks
- Verify courses are actually in the target state
- Check for duplicate detection accuracy
- Validate course type classification

### Performance Monitoring
- API quota usage vs. discovery rate
- Processing time per state
- Error rates and failure patterns

## Migration Strategy

1. **Test Phase**: Run enhanced search on a few states to validate improvements
2. **Comparison Phase**: Compare results with previous method
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Process states with known gaps first
4. **Full Deployment**: Replace previous method with enhanced version

## API Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Maintained respectful delays between requests
- Longer pauses between states to avoid quota issues
- Pagination handling for large result sets

### Cost Management
- More searches per coordinate point but better efficiency
- Larger radius reduces need for additional coordinate points
- Enhanced validation reduces wasted API calls on invalid courses

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Dynamic radius adjustment based on population density
- Machine learning for better course type classification
- Integration with additional golf course databases for validation
- Automated coordinate point optimization based on discovery patterns
